# Video-shot-change-detection
The shot change detection algorithm is realized by examining the similarity between two continuous frames (i.e., test_img=135.jpg and data_img=136.jpg), which will be further compared to the threshold, in order to indicates the frame (i.e., data_img=136.jpg) whether it is a shot change or not.
